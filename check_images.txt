Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, both the VGG and ResNet models correctly classified dog_01 and dog_02 as German Shepherds. However, while AlexNet correctly classified dog_01 as a German Shepherd, it incorrectly classified dog_02 as a Malinois.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: yes, the three model architectures correctly classify Tiger_01.jpg and Laptop_01.jpg to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I believe the VGG model performed the best. It correctly classified both dog_01 and dog_02 as dogs and identified their breed as German Shepherd. It also correctly classified Tiger_01.jpg as not a dog and identified it as a tiger. Impressively, for the fourth image, Laptop_01.jpg, which is an image of a laptop, the model correctly identified it as not a dog and classified it as a screen, which is accurate.
